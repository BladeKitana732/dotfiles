# Linux Mint Configuration Notes

Parts of Linux Mint are configured manually through a GUI.
Since I cannot script these parts of setup, this document serves as a reminder for those necessary manual steps.

## Themes

I currently use the Windows 10 Light Theme.
Below are the GUI configurations for my optimal config:

* Window borders: Windows 10

* Controls: Windows 10
* Mouse Pointer: DMZ-White
* Desktop: Windows 10

## Effects

Turn off all effects other than "Overlay scroll bars"

## Keyboard

    * Switch to left workspace: Ctrl+Alt+k
    * Switch to right workspace: Ctrl+Alt+j
  * Launchers
    * Launch terminal: Ctrl+Alt+i
